# Improvements and missing features

## missing features & bugs

Currently there are some bugs present in the code. Unfortunately there 
wasn't enought time to track down all the bugs and fix them. When some of 
the forms are left blank, it might app to cause errors, even though 
these forms are validated. In the current state the "Tier" system, 
a elo-ranking system for horses is not implemented meaning the 
tier number doesn't mean anything. Winners are chosen randomly.

## Improvomenets

The app should send more error messages etc... to users. As of 
right now the program doesn't inform the user very well if 
something goes wrong. The code itself code could be more clear and 
therefore it needs to be refactored. This would make further 
development much easier and the code would be more readable. 
The current set of implemented features is almost 1:1 according to
the plan, so at this point I woudln't develope more features and 
would try focusing on fixing the bugs.
