a new account is created. 

## Placing bets 

Users are able to place bets by clicking "Place bets"

races that are currently open to betting. After winner

to the amount. 

## Adding races (Admin access only)

When admin logs in, races can be added by clicking "Add races"
button. Each races must have name, location and short description. 
Horses must be also associated with the race (which horses are attending), 
which can be chosen from a list. 

## Adding horses (Admin access only)

### This feature is not implemented yet

Horses can be added by clicking "Add horses" click. Each 
horse is given name, breed, "tier" and description. Tier 
determines how good contender each horse is. Horses climb 
up the tier-ladder by winning races and by losing they 
go down the ladder. This is similiar to generic [ELO-rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system).
Admin is able to delete horses from this page also, (when 
horses retire, this might be useful).
